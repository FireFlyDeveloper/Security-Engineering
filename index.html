        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The widespread use of the Internet in the 1990s introduced a new challenge for software
                engineers—designing and implementing systems that were secure. As more
                and more systems were connected to the Internet, a variety of different external
                attacks were devised to threaten these systems. The problems of producing dependable systems were hugely
                increased. Systems engineers had to consider threats from
                malicious and technically skilled attackers as well as problems resulting from accidental mistakes in
                the development process.</p>
            <p>It is now essential to design systems to withstand external attacks and to recover from
                such attacks. Without security precautions, it is almost inevitable that attackers will compromise a
                networked system. They may misuse the system hardware, steal confidential
                data, or disrupt the services offered by the system. System security engineering is therefore an
                increasingly important aspect of the systems engineering process.</p>
            <p>Security engineering is concerned with the development and evolution of systems
                that can resist malicious attacks, which are intended to damage the system or its data.
                Software security engineering is part of the more general field of computer security.
                This has become a priority for businesses and individuals as more and more criminals try to exploit
                networked systems for illegal purposes. Software engineers should
                be aware of the security threats faced by systems and ways in which these threats can
                be neutralized.</p>
            <p>My intention in this chapter is to introduce security engineering to software engineers, with a focus on
                design issues that affect application security. The chapter is
                not about computer security as a whole and so doesn’t cover topics such as encryption, access control,
                authorization mechanisms, viruses and Trojan horses, etc. These
                are described in detail in general texts on computer security (Anderson, 2008;
                Bishop, 2005; Pfleeger and Pfleeger, 2007).</p>
            <p>The majority of external attacks focus on system infrastructures because infrastructure components (e.g.,
                web browsers) are well known and widely available.
                Attackers can probe these systems for weaknesses and share information about vulnerabilities that they
                have discovered. As many people use the same software,
                attacks have wide applicability. Infrastructure vulnerabilities may lead to attackers
                gaining unauthorized access to an application system and its data.
                In practice, there is an important distinction between application security and
                infrastructure security:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Application security is a software engineering problem where software engineers should ensure that
                    the system is designed to resist attacks.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure security is a management problem where system managers configure the infrastructure
                    to resist attacks. System managers have to set up the
                    infrastructure to make the most effective use of whatever infrastructure security</li>
            </ol>
            features are available. They also have to repair infrastructure security vulnerabilities that come to light
            as the software is used.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>System security management is not a single task but includes a range of activities
                such as user and permission management, system software deployment and maintenance, and attack
                monitoring, detection and recovery:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>User and permission management includes adding and removing users from the
                    system, ensuring that appropriate user authentication mechanisms are in place
                    and setting up the permissions in the system so that users only have access to the
                    resources that they need.</li>
                <li>System software deployment and maintenance includes installing system software and middleware and
                    configuring these properly so that security vulnerabilities are avoided. It also involves updating
                    this software regularly with new
                    versions or patches, which repair security problems that have been discovered.</li>
                <li>Attack monitoring, detection and recovery includes activities which monitor the
                    system for unauthorized access, detect, and put in place strategies for resisting
                    attacks, and backup activities so that normal operation can be resumed after an
                    external attack.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Security management is vitally important, but it is not usually considered to be part of application
                security engineering. Rather, application security engineering is concerned with designing a system so
                that it is as secure as possible, given budget
                and usability constraints. Part of this process is ‘design for management’, where you
                design systems to minimize the chance of security management errors leading to
                successful attacks on the system. For critical control systems and embedded systems, it is normal
                practice to
                select an appropriate infrastructure to support the application system. For example, embedded system
                developers usually choose a real-time operating system
                that provides the embedded application with the facilities that it needs. Known
                vulnerabilities and security requirements can be taken into account. This means
                that an holistic approach can be taken to security engineering. Application security requirements may be
                implemented through the infrastructure or the application itself.
                However, application systems in an organization are usually implemented using
                the existing infrastructure (operating system, database, etc.). Therefore, the risks of
                using that infrastructure and its security features must be taken into account as part
                of the system design process.</p>
