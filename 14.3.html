                <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                <p><strong>System Survivability</strong> is an emergent property of a system that reflects its ability
                    to continue delivering essential services while under attack or after part of the system has been
                    damaged.</p>
            </div>

            <p>So far, we've discussed security engineering from the perspective of an application under development
                where the system procurer and developer have control over all aspects that might be attacked. In
                reality, as suggested in Figure 14.1, modern distributed systems inevitably rely on an infrastructure
                that includes off-the-shelf systems and reusable components developed by different organizations.</p>

            <p>This means that, irrespective of how much attention is paid to security, it cannot be guaranteed that a
                system will be able to resist external attacks. Consequently, for complex networked systems, you should
                assume that penetration is possible and that the integrity of the system cannot be guaranteed. You
                should therefore think about how to make the system resilient so that it survives to deliver essential
                services to users.</p>

            <div class="interactive-box">
                <h3>Real-World Connection</h3>
                <p>Consider how modern cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud implement survivability
                    strategies through redundancy, geographic distribution, and automated failover mechanisms.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Survivability or resilience is an emergent property of a system as a whole, rather than a property of
                individual components, which may not themselves be survivable. The survivability of a system reflects
                its ability to continue to deliver essential business or mission-critical services to legitimate users
                while it is under attack or after part of the system has been damaged. The damage could be caused by an
                attack or by a system failure.</p>

            <p>Work on system survivability was prompted by the fact that our economic and social lives are dependent on
                a computer-controlled critical infrastructure. This includes the infrastructure for delivering utilities
                (power, water, gas, etc.) and, equally critically, the infrastructure for delivering and managing
                information (telephones, Internet, postal service, etc.). However, survivability is not simply a
                critical infrastructure issue. Any organization that relies on critical networked computer systems
                should be concerned with how its business would be affected if their systems did not survive a malicious
                attack or catastrophic system failure. Therefore, for business critical systems, survivability analysis
                and design should be part of the security engineering process.</p>

            <div class="definition">
                <p><strong>Critical Infrastructure:</strong> Systems and assets so vital that their incapacitation or
                    destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, economic security, public health, or
                    safety.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Maintaining the availability of critical services is the essence of survivability. This means that you
                have to know:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The system services that are the most critical for a business</li>
                <li>The minimal quality of service that must be maintained</li>
                <li>How these services might be compromised</li>
                <li>How these services can be protected</li>
                <li>How you can recover quickly if the services become unavailable</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Case Study: Ambulance Dispatch System</h3>
                <p>In a system that handles ambulance dispatch in response to emergency calls, the critical services are
                    those concerned with taking calls and dispatching ambulances to the medical emergency. Other
                    services, such as call logging and ambulance location management, are less critical, either because
                    they do not require real-time processing or because alternative mechanisms may be used. For example,
                    to find an ambulance's location you can call the ambulance crew and ask them where they are.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Ellison and colleagues (1999a; 1999b; 2002) have designed a method of analysis called Survivable Systems
                Analysis. This is used to assess vulnerabilities in systems and to support the design of system
                architectures and features that promote system survivability. They argue that achieving survivability
                depends on three complementary strategies:</p>

            <div class="strategy-grid">
                <div class="strategy-card resistance">
                    <h3>Resistance</h3>
                    <p>Avoiding problems by building capabilities into the system to repel attacks. For example, a
                        system may use digital certificates to authenticate users, thus making it more difficult for
                        unauthorized users to gain access.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Multi-factor authentication, encryption, firewalls</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card recognition">
                    <h3>Recognition</h3>
                    <p>Detecting problems by building capabilities into the system to detect attacks and failures and
                        assess the resultant damage. For example, checksums may be associated with critical data so that
                        corruptions to that data can be detected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Intrusion detection systems, log monitoring, integrity checks</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card recovery">
                    <h3>Recovery</h3>
                    <p>Tolerating problems by building capabilities into the system to deliver essential services while
                        under attack, and to recover full functionality after an attack. For example, fault tolerance
                        mechanisms using diverse implementations of the same functionality may be included to cope with
                        a loss of service from one part of the system.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Backup systems, failover mechanisms, disaster recovery plans</p>

            <h2>Survivable Systems Analysis Process</h2>
            <p>Survivable systems analysis is a four-stage process (Figure 14.8) that analyzes the current or proposed
                system requirements and architecture; identifies critical services, attack scenarios, and system
                'softspots'; and proposes changes to improve the survivability of a system.</p>

            <div class="interactive-box">
                <h3>Process Overview</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>System Understanding</strong> - Review mission objectives, requirements, and
                        architecture</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical Service Identification</strong> - Identify services that must always be
                        maintained</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack Simulation</strong> - Identify attack scenarios and affected components</li>
                    <li><strong>Survivability Analysis</strong> - Identify vulnerable components and survivability
                        strategies</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>The key activities in each of these stages are as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><em>System understanding</em> For an existing or proposed system, review the goals of the system
                        (sometimes called the mission objectives), the system requirements, and the system architecture.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><em>Critical service identification</em> The services that must always be maintained and the
                        components that are required to maintain these services are identified.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><em>Attack simulation</em> Scenarios or use cases for possible attacks are identified along with
                        the system components that would be affected by these attacks.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><em>Survivability analysis</em> Components that are both essential and compromisable by an attack
                        are identified and survivability strategies based on resistance, recognition, and recovery are
                        identified.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Equity Trading System Example</h3>
                <p>Ellison and his colleagues present an excellent case study of the method based on a system to support
                    mental health treatment (1999b). Rather than repeat their analysis, we use the equity trading
                    system, as shown in Figure 14.5, to illustrate some of the features of survivability analysis.</p>

                <p>As you can see from Figure 14.5, this system has already made some provision for survivability. User
                    accounts and equity prices are replicated across servers so that orders can be placed even if the
                    local server is unavailable. Let's assume that the capability for authorized users to place orders
                    for stock is the key service that must be maintained. To ensure that users trust the system, it is
                    essential that integrity be maintained. Orders must be accurate and reflect the actual sales or
                    purchases made by a system user.</p>
            </div>

            <img src="image1.png" alt="Survivability analysis process diagram" class="visual-element">
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Applying Survivability Analysis</h2>
            <p>To maintain the ordering service in our equity trading system, there are three components of the system
                that are used:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em>User authentication</em> - This allows authorized users to log on to the system.</li>
                <li><em>Price quotation</em> - This allows the buying and selling price of a stock to be quoted.</li>
                <li><em>Order placement</em> - This allows buy and sell orders at a given price to be made.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These components obviously make use of essential data assets such as a user account database, a price
                database, and an order transaction database. These must survive attacks if service is to be maintained.
            </p>

            <p>There are several different types of attack on this system that might be made. Let's consider two
                possibilities here:</p>

            <div class="interactive-box">
                <h3>Attack Scenarios</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A malicious user has a grudge against an accredited system user. He gains access to the system
                        using their credentials. Malicious orders are placed and stock is bought and sold, with the
                        intention of causing problems for the authorized user.</li>
                    <li>An unauthorized user corrupts the database of transactions by gaining permission to issue SQL
                        commands directly. Reconciliation of sales and purchases is therefore impossible.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <img src="image1.png" alt="Survivability strategies for equity trading system" class="visual-element">

            <p>Figure 14.9 shows examples of resistance, recognition, and recovery strategies that might be used to help
                counter these attacks.</p>

            <p>Increasing the survivability or resilience of a system of course costs money. Companies may be reluctant
                to invest in survivability if they have never suffered a serious attack or associated loss. However,
                just as it is best to buy good locks and an alarm before rather than after your house is burgled, it is
                best to invest in survivability before, rather than after, a successful attack. Survivability analysis
                is not yet part of most software engineering processes but, as more and more systems become business
                critical, such analyzes are likely to become more widely used.</p>

                <h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security engineering focuses on how to develop and maintain software systems that can resist
                        malicious attacks intended to damage a computer-based system or its data.</li>
                    <li>Security threats can be threats to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system
                        or its data.</li>
                    <li>Security risk management involves assessing the losses that might ensue from attacks on a
                        system, and deriving security requirements that are aimed at eliminating or reducing these
                        losses.</li>
                    <li>Design for security involves designing a secure system architecture, following good practice for
                        secure systems design, and including functionality to minimize the possibility of introducing
                        vulnerabilities when the system is deployed.</li>
                    <li>Key issues when designing a secure systems architecture include organizing the system structure
                        to protect key assets and distributing the system assets to minimize the losses from a
                        successful attack.</li>
                    <li>Security design guidelines sensitize system designers to security issues that they may not have
                        considered. They provide a basis for creating security review checklists.</li>
                    <li>To support secure deployment you should provide a way of displaying and analyzing system
                        configurations, localize configuration settings so that important configurations are not
                        forgotten, minimize default privileges assigned to system users, and provide ways to repair
                        security vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li>System survivability reflects the ability of a system to continue to deliver essential business
                        or mission-critical services to legitimate users while it is under attack, or after part of the
                        system has been damaged.</li>
